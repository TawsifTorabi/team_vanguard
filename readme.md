# vanguard RC Car

Vanguard is the alias we worked under the UIU MARS ROVER TEAM intern program. We were tasked to develop a RC car by ourselves with our own programming, systems, and creativity. 
I came up with several ideas with my teammates, and the most fun one is the **ESP32Async** websocket connected to RC Car. This is fast and responsive, and you can drive that RC car with a USB Game controller.
